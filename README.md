# How Do I Log Thee



## How Do I Log Thee? (Sonnet 43)

## (adapted from Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1806 - 1861)

How do I log thee? Let me count the ways.

I log thee to the depth and breadth and height

My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight

For the ends of being and ideal grace.

I log thee to the level of every day’s

Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.

I log thee freely, as men strive for right.

I log thee purely, as they turn from praise.

I log thee with the passion put to use

In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.

I log thee with a log I seemed to lose

With my lost saints. I log thee with the breath,

Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,

I shall but log thee better after death.
